1. Ready Player Me Avatar Management (Front End)
MeetinVR uses Ready Player Me to let the user create a custom avatar for use in the app. The
user visits our web portal to change their avatar through the ready player me web app, which is
embedded in an iframe. After creating their avatar Ready Player Me sends a url to our frontend
with the model for the avatar. This URL is not guaranteed to change for every avatar.
Implement a quick simple page for managing your avatar. You should be able to view your
current avatar, create a new avatar, and keep a list of saved avatars for future use.
The web page should use React or Next.js, and should reflect your ability to implement a
feature in a way that both looks good to the user and works reliably.
Ignore any backend functionality. The web app does not need to actually function, but only show
mock data. Actual 3D models are also optional. Cut any corners you feel necessary.
